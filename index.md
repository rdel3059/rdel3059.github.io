## My favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* **Lab 6: Blackjack Hand Calculator**

    Lab 6 was neat because it helped me connect one of my hobbies, playing cards, with programming. 
    I built a Blackjack hand calculator that scored hands using modular functions like IsAce, CardPoints, and TwoCardHandScore. 
    It reinforced input validation and conditional logic for handling special cases like the Ace bonus, making me appreciate how games I enjoy can be modeled through code.

* **Lab 7: Parking Rules**

    Lab 7 expanded my skills by teaching me how to model real-world rules, like street parking restrictions, through input validation and logical conditions. 
    I wrote separate functions for different streets, applying unique parking rules based on day and time. 
    This project deepened my understanding of real-world data processing, which was crucial in my next project working with California’s population data.

* **Lab 10: California Counties Population Lookup**

    Lab 10 focused on data organization using 2D vectors to manage California’s county population data. 
    I built functions to search for counties, retrieve populations, and calculate percentages of the state population. 
    This project tied together my earlier work with logical conditions and data processing, showing me how programming scales to handle larger datasets.
